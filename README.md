# ElmarApp

The ElmarApp program was created for the needs of a construction company and struggles with the need to use a paper calendar to document completed projects.
After the project is completed, the Elmar-W company gives a 5-year warranty for the workmanship and parts used in this project.

The project was created on the basis of JavaFX so that it can be placed on a USB flash drive and connected to any computer.
